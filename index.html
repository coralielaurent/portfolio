      </h3>
      <p>In this analysis, I explored global air pollution levels by examining the distribution of Air Quality Index (AQI) values across different countries and continents. Below is an outline of the key steps I followed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distribution of AQI Values:</strong> I used boxplots and histograms to identify the distribution of AQI values and detect any outliers in the dataset.</li>

        <li><strong>Top 20 Countries by Median AQI:</strong> Using a boxplot, I selected the top 20 countries with the highest median AQI values, giving insight into the regions with the most significant air pollution concerns.</li>

        <li><strong>Mapping Countries to Continents:</strong> I created a dictionary to map countries to their respective continents to enhance readability. This was followed by a continent-level boxplot to understand which continent had the worst air quality.</li>

        <li><strong>Top 10 and Bottom 10 Countries by Mean AQI:</strong> I sorted countries by their mean AQI values in descending order and highlighted the top 10 and bottom 10 countries in terms of air quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This analysis provides a clear view of global air pollution trends, allowing for a better understanding of how air quality varies across countries and continents.</p>
