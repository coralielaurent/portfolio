## My Data Analysis Portfolio

### My projects
#### Project 1: Global Air Pollution Analysis

In this analysis, I explored global air pollution levels by examining the distribution of Air Quality Index (AQI) values across different countries and continents. Below is an outline of the key steps I followed:

Distribution of AQI Values:

I used boxplots and histograms to identify the distribution of AQI values and detect any outliers in the dataset.

Top 20 Countries by Median AQI:

Using a boxplot, I selected the top 20 countries with the highest median AQI values, giving insight into the regions with the most significant air pollution concerns.

Mapping Countries to Continents:

I created a dictionary to map countries to their respective continents to enhance readability.
This was followed by a continent-level boxplot to understand which continent had the worst air quality.

Top 10 and Bottom 10 Countries by Mean AQI:

I sorted countries by their mean AQI values in descending order and highlighted the top 10 and bottom 10 countries in terms of air quality.

This analysis provides a clear view of global air pollution trends, allowing for a better understanding of how air quality varies across countries and continents.

#### Project 2: Taylor Swift Discography Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Taylor Swift's discography, focusing on song characteristics and their impact on popularity. The following steps outline the process and key insights:

Data Cleaning:

I cleaned the dataset by keeping only one version of each album (specifically, Taylor's Version) in the album column.
Live versions of albums were removed to improve the readability and accuracy of further analysis.

Analysis:

Comparison of Popularity by Tempo and Danceability: 
I analyzed how song tempo and danceability influenced the popularity of Taylor Swift's tracks.

Correlation Analysis: I examined the correlation between various song characteristics (such as energy, acousticness, and valence) and their popularity to uncover patterns within her music.
This analysis provided valuable insights into how different musical elements contribute to the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs.
